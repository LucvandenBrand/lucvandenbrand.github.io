Hello! My name is Luc and I am a freelance software engineer housed at the [Game Bakery](https://gamebakery.nl/). Engineering effective solutions to problems in Game Development is my specialty.

I used to (and sometimes still do!) teach students as a Teaching Assistant for the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl). I have thought a diverse range of subjects in Computing Science, from _Advanced Object Oriented Programming_ to _Software Startups and Requirements Engineering_.
