Hello! My name is Luc and I am a freelance software engineer housed at the [Game Bakery](https://gamebakery.nl/). Engineering effective solutions to problems in Game Development is my specialty.

I used to (and sometimes still do!) teach students as a Teaching Assistant for the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl). I have thought a diverse range of subjects in Computing Science, from _Advanced Object Oriented Programming_ to _Software Startups and Requirements Engineering_.

## What I do
Computer scientists are blessed with the fact that we can wiggle ourselves into **any field or subject that peeks our interest**. Smart algorithms and computational models can describe anything from the likelihood of enjoying a movie to the collision of galaxies between millions of stars. I am no different, and have worked on things such as:

- Language learning platforms
- Reversible computing
- Porting games to modern consoles
- Visual novel game engines

...and more. If you have a problem you need to get solved, then please do not hesitate to [get in contact](/contact)! Simply want to read about some of the things I do? Then the [blog](/blog) and [projects](/projects) page should be a good place to start.
