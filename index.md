Hello! My name is Luc and I am a Software Engineer. This site is a place for me to centralize access to my personal and professional projects and to write about anything I fancy.

I used to teach students as a Teaching Assistant for the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl) until I finished my MSc in 2020. I have taught a diverse range of subjects in Computing Science, from _Advanced Object Oriented Programming_ to _Software Startups and Requirements Engineering_. 

After my TA work I freelanced in the game industry for about 2 years, working with some truly talented people. Today I'm a backend software engineer at [Belsimpel](https://www.belsimpel.nl/). I architect and plan robost solutions to complex problems, help implement them, and perform a number of business related tasks in between.

In my spare time I work on secret projects that either grow or wither from lack of attention, with this place being the first to hear about it.

## What I do
Computer Scientists are blessed with the fact that we can wiggle ourselves into **any field or subject that peeks our interest**. Smart algorithms and computational models can describe anything from the likelihood of enjoying a movie to the collision of galaxies between millions of stars. I am no different, and have worked on things such as:

- Language learning platforms
- Reversible computing
- Programming retro game consoles
- Game development tools
- Visual novel game engines
- Competitive e-commerce backend systems
- Emulation
- Porting games to different platforms
- Gameplay programming

...and more. Want to read about some of the things I do? Then the [blog](/blog) and [projects](/projects) page should be a good place to start. Want to talk to me about something? Please do not hesitate to [get in contact](/contact)!
