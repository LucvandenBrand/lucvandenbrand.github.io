When a colleague of mine asked if I would like to have a collection of his old 3.5" floppy disks, I instantly said yes. Like most computer nerds, [I'm inclined to be nostalgic about ageing technology]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-22-Tiled2GBA %}), so declining his offer was simply not an option. This however lead to the logical dilemma, what am I to with all these floppies? After making a backup of all the data (I'm now a proud owner of [Yogo Yogo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMq6_ogCmoA) for MS DOS), the disks were just collecting dust in a corner of my office. 

In order to make some use out of them, I created a challenge for myself: 

**Fill all 242 floppies with your own software.**

There are no additional rules, as long as the program fits, it sits. I will be sharing my progress on this blog, where I'll try to explain how every floppy has been filled for those who might be interested. Of course I do not expect this project to end anytime soon. However, why the rush? I'm looking forward to seeing what I'll learn during the upcoming years :).

For every floppy filled, I will add an entry to the project's main website: [https://floppychallenge.com](https://floppychallenge.com). Do you want to follow the project more closely? Feel free to star the associated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LucvandenBrand/FloppyChallenge).
