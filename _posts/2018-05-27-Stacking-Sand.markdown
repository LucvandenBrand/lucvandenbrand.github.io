Tetris, according to its [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris){:target="_blank"}, is 
>the first entertainment software to be exported from the Soviet Union to the US.

This seemed to be a good choice, as in the west Tetris has been proven to be wildy successful.
At least a million[^1] variants of tetris must exist by now. However, despite the vast number of innovations on the field of _tetrology_[^2], proper western adaptions seem to be lacking. 

In order to do something about this cultural void, I hereby announce **Stacking Sand with  Bill Bigsby**: Tetris with more **CAPITALISM**.

In addition to a more monetary focus, the game features a storyline _loosely_ inspired by 19th-century-America's mining barons.

[^1]: Or less, according to [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Tetris_variants){:target="_blank"}. In any case, my gut says it's a million and we can all agree that such a number sounds way more impressive.
