As a challenge, [I am trying to write source code for a large number of 3.5" floppy disks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-10-04-Floppy-Challenge %}). As of a few days ago, **I completed my second floppy.** It is a text adventure. You can find the sources [here](https://github.com/LucvandenBrand/FloppyChallenge/tree/master/floppies/text-adventure). The game is also listed on the [Floppy Challenge website](https://floppychallenge.com) if you just want the binaries.

I'm sad to say that I never got to play much text adventures as a kid. I was of the Freddy Fish generation: colourful graphics and simple buttons clearly explaining to me what is happening and what I am able to do. It was only in my early teens that I learned about the old Ultima games.
