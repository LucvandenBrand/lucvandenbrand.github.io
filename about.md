Hello! My name is Luc and I am a freelance consultant housed at the [Game Bakery](https://gamebakery.nl/). Engineering effective solutions to problems in Game Development is my speciality. 

I used to (and sometimes still do!) teach students as a Teaching Assistant for the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl). I have thought a diverse range of subjects in Computing Science, from _Advanced Object Oriented Programming_ to _Software Startups and Requirements Engineering_.

During my teaching years, I tried to make an effort to rekindle some of the fun others might have lost on their journey in becoming a software engineer. Programming is serious business, and should be treated as such. However, it is also cool, funny, and endlessly enjoyable.

This blog tries to focus on the latter, whilst showing that fun does not mean carelessness and ugly code. On the contrary, the most fun is had when your code is clean, neat, and adorably short.
